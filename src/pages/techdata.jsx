        Article: " In the US, ongoing delays to the production of vehicles, combined with problems in finding adequate capacity for the vehicles that are actually made, has led to demand outstripping supply. Dealer inventory is currently around 1.1m units, equating to a 25-day supply, 70% below pre-Covid levels. OEMs are operating on a model that more resembles build-to-order than build-to-stock. That has put greater pressure on the sector to look for support from technology providers that can automate services such as vehicle inspection and yard management.  At this year’s Finished Vehicle Logistics North America conference in Huntington Beach, California Ed Jones, chief commercial officer at vehicle inspection expert DeGould, noted there had been a definite shift in attitude within the sector and OEMs were looking for support and services to make the delivery of their cars more efficient and transparent.  Shifting attitudesDigital vehicle inspection systems, such as the ones DeGould offers, are automated and run on AI software and computer vision. DeGould’s Auto-compact vehicle inspection module, to take one example, features seven cameras that capture ultra-high-resolution images, together with two dedicated wheel cameras and seven analysis cameras to detect any vehicle damage. Vehicles can drive through the module, helping to increase throughput and save time.  As well as speeding up the inspection process, the technology has the potential to improve the quality and efficiency of the damage detection process, and remove the potential for human error. This is what the industry is now looking for, according to Jones, and companies are eager to learn about what the technology has the scope to do and how to implement it through the vehicle delivery process.  “What we are seeing now is a massive shift in attitude,” he said. “People are more and more coming to us and asking how quick we can get these things in. Despite all the headwinds it has accelerated the need for this technology",
